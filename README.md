 Installation:
 A Simple Registration Form is a user-friendly form template designed to collect basic information from individuals or organizations across different sectors who wish to register for a service, platform, or membership.This Course Registration Form template can be used by any school/institution to accept registration on various educational programs that are offered at that particular institute or the school. I have made it a simple one in the sense that it can easily be installed and run on any available OS that includes microsoft and mac OS as well. this platform can further be developed to a more robust program which can be able to obtain data not only from a xlnx data file but can maybe able to look at access as well as adobe etc.

 Usage 
 Basically this program is tailor made for school instituions this mostly start-ups that will be expecting to grow rapidly in a short period of time, having to face a surge of nre applicants and farly new registrations. this program may also be utilized for admistratative processes at any institutions in assisting by keeping track of number of students that have to register and the new and the retaining one without having to lose the data having been already be collected by th institution. Data collection is made and keeping this data assist in increasing the intergrity of the institutions and may avoid loss of data due to the use of manual ways of collecting as well as storing the data, this is one of the sysndrome that is assosciated with goverment institutes but by intriducing this system might as well be an automation of data colletion and wqe ll as data storage.![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a77da50e-8e4a-4a60-9d14-4475b59ac28f)

Contribution
looking at this system holistically in a view of a country to country the population ie all students or anyone has a constitutional right of a fair school application and registration at any instituition that one deem favourable to their choice. This system has a right and is mandated to accept any students without any descrimination based on anything ie race etc therefore at any given time one personal data should be guided jealosly and safe so at to be utilized for further requirements if need be. This registration system have the mandate to be utilized for statistical purposes this will contribute to the goverments or any other institution acquire knowledge based of stakeholders needs and wants regarding school curruclum. This can also be referenced by financial instituitions to acertain the need for funding and wether the requirements for these are met by the students
